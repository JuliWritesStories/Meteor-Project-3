# Meteor-Project-3
Meteors are out of this world! Yet the tales they tell hit incredibly close to home. They are traveling histories that can teach us more about our existence than one might think. The composition of every meteor informs us how our solar system has evolved. They detail changes in our sun, inlfuences on each planet, and what possible futures humanity could have. That information is invaluable to scientists. But despite its importance, meteorite data is incredibly hard to capture. Thousands of meteors hit Earth every year creating data points that are far too numerous to analyze by hand. Our meteorite dashboard aims to streamline this process. 

Our dashboard presents five easy to understand visualizations, an interactive map of landing locations, and an informative homepage for learners of any level. Our data is sourced directly from NASA and is safely stored within a SQLite database. Our data represents over 37,000 meteorites dating from 860 C.E. to 2013 C.E. That is over a thousand years of data! With the meteorite dashboard in hand, your dreams of understanding our solar system are well within reach. 

To start, input python app.py into your terminal to launch the dashboard. Ctrl click the running link once it appears. This will take you to the following home page.
